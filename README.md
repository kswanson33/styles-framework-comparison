Compares 3 options for refactoring the styles framework found at https://github.com/openstax/ce-styles.

3 options found in folders:
- `ruby`
- `sass`
- `typescript`

Example of current framework is found in the `current framework` folder.

Example of some CSS generated by the current framework is found in the `current-css` folder.

The CSS generated from the `sass` folder is in the `css` folder (this is confusing)

## To build

- Sass (original framework) - lacks the framework to build here
- Sass (new framework) - `docker run -v $PWD/sass:/sass/ -v $PWD/css:/css/ -it michalklempa/dart-sass:latest` (writes to `css` folder)
- Ruby - write string to file (see `ruby/notes-cardboard.rb`)
- Typescript - pseudocode only, no build :(

## Evaluation:

Sass:
+ Good support for input of CSS, strong validation
+ Support for **automated source mapping**
* Variables not always clickable across files
- Syntax is more clunky - all advanced stuff sits on top of CSS
+ Nested CSS compiles to flattened CSS

Ruby:
* CSS input with heredocs. Validation/colorization is pretty good but sometimes buggy
- No support for source mapping. A few hacky manual options.
* Variables not always clickable across files
+ Nice programmatic syntax
- Nested CSS remains nested

TS:
* CSS input - similar to heredocs, a VSCode extension allows colorization
* Source mapping support is present but **manual only**
* Variables not always clickable across files
- Not as nice syntax as Ruby (imo)
- Nested CSS remains nested
